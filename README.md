## Java Algo for FX and Stocks Trading Using SMA

This project show cases a simple Java algorithm that performs trading operations on Foreign Exchange (FX) and stocks using the Simple Moving Average (SMA) strategy.
This Java algorithm is a simple base code for FX and stocks trading that utilizes the Simple Moving Average (SMA) strategy to facilitate automated trading decisions
in the FX and stock markets. This algorithm leverages SMA indicators to trigger buy/sell actions based on moving average crossovers with considerations to a bullish
and bearish trends.

# Overview 
This Java algorithm leverages the Simple Moving Average (SMA) strategy for trading in the Foreign Exchange (FX) and stock markets. The algorithm implements a basic
SMA-based trading strategy for performing buy/sell actions based on the crossing of short and long-term moving averages.
   
# Key Features:
 - SMA-based Strategy: Utilizes the Simple Moving Average methodology to evaluate market trends and fluctuations.

 - Automated Trading Actions: Executes buy/sell orders autonomously based on calculated moving average crossovers.

 - FX and Stocks Integration: Works in both the Foreign Exchange and stock markets for diversified trading capabilities.

# Requirements
Java Development Kit (JDK): Install JDK version 8 or higher.

# Installation
## Installation Guide
Before installing ensure you have :
- An operating system: Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- Java runtime enviroment(JRE): Install JRE version 8 or higher.
- Internet connection: It is required for fetching the real-time data.

## Installation Steps

## Step 1: Download or clone repository
### Download ZIP or Clone the Repository:
  - GitHub: Visit the repository page on GitHub (provide repository URL) and click on "Clone or download" > "Download ZIP."
  - Git: Alternatively, if you have Git installed, use git clone <repository URL> in your terminal or command prompt.

## Step 2: Set Up Environment
### Check Java Installation:
  - Open a terminal or command prompt and type java -version to confirm that Java is installed and properly configured.
  - Extract ZIP (If downloaded):
     - If you downloaded a ZIP file, extract it to a location of your choice.

## Step 3: Build and Run
### Build the Application (if necessary):
  - Depending on the project structure, you may need to build the application. 
  - Run the Application:
      - Execute the application using the provided executable file or command. For Java applications, you might run a command like java -jar <app-name>.jar
        and and JSON-java.

# Usage and Configuration
## Usage:
   - Explore the user interface or APIs provided by the application.
   - Configuration
      - The application requires configuration, such as API keys.  

  - Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
    
# Functionalities:
- Indicator Calculation: Computes short-term and long-term moving averages for analysis.
  
- Signal Generation: Triggers buy/sell actions upon the occurrence of moving average crossover signals.
  
- Position Management: Monitors and manages open positions based on market changes.
  
# Benefits:
- Objective Decision-making: Removes emotional bias, making data-driven trading decisions.
  
- Increased Efficiency: Automates repetitive tasks, allowing for timely responses to market conditions.

- Strategy Testing: Provides a framework for strategy testing and potential optimization.

# Use Case:
This Java algorithm is suitable for beginners seeking an automated approach to trading. Its reliance on SMA-based signals assists in generating trading strategies based on 
technical analysis, potentially reducing human error in decision-making processes.

# Improvements:
Beginners to algo coding can use this as a basis to work from down up.
