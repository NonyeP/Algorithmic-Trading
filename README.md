## Java Algo for FX and Stocks Trading Using SMA

This project show cases a simple Java algorithm that performs trading operations on Foreign Exchange (FX) and stocks using the Simple Moving Average (SMA) strategy.
This Java algorithm is a simple base code for FX and stocks trading that utilizes the Simple Moving Average (SMA) strategy to facilitate automated trading decisions
in the FX and stock markets. This algorithm leverages SMA indicators to trigger buy/sell actions based on moving average crossovers with considerations to a bullish
and bearish trends.

# Key Features:
 - SMA-based Strategy: Utilizes the Simple Moving Average methodology to evaluate market trends and fluctuations.

 - Automated Trading Actions: Executes buy/sell orders autonomously based on calculated moving average crossovers.

 - FX and Stocks Integration: Works in both the Foreign Exchange and stock markets for diversified trading capabilities.

# Functionalities:
- Indicator Calculation: Computes short-term and long-term moving averages for analysis.
  
- Signal Generation: Triggers buy/sell actions upon the occurrence of moving average crossover signals.
  
- Position Management: Monitors and manages open positions based on market changes.
  
# Benefits:
- Objective Decision-making: Removes emotional bias, making data-driven trading decisions.
  
- Increased Efficiency: Automates repetitive tasks, allowing for timely responses to market conditions.

- Strategy Testing: Provides a framework for strategy testing and potential optimization.

# Use Case:
This Java algorithm is suitable for beginners seeking an automated approach to trading. Its reliance on SMA-based signals assists in generating trading strategies based on 
technical analysis, potentially reducing human error in decision-making processes.

# Improvements:
Beginners to algo coding can use this as a basis to work from down up.
